Ochothon
_________

Ochothon is a little add-on you can drop onto a Mesos_ cluster running Marathon_ to quickly get started with Ochopod_.
It comes with a little web-shell and provides lean remoting as well. We embed a bunch of tools that allow you to list,
query, deploy and shutdown your Ochopod_ containers.

It is 100% made of Python_ with a dash of JQuery_ for the web-shell !
